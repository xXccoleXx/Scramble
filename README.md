# Scramble
Java program that visually encrypts a picture with symmetric encryption    

Utilizes the Java Picture Class found here https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Picture.java.html    
Be sure to have the Picture Class in the same directory/package as Scramble.

# Instructions:
Open the Scramble java file with your favorite java IDE.    
Ensure Scramble can access Picture.    
Only change the file names in the main method. The first is the input file and the second is the output destination file.    
Run the main method. Check current folder for the newly encrypted photo.    
To undo the encryption, simply run the encypted photo through the program again. (symmetric encryption!)    

# Warnings:
Must input jpg, jpeg, or png file.    
Only output with png file.    
Do not resize or crop an encrypted photo (ruins symmetric encryption).    
Do not reformat encypted photo to another format such as jpeg/jpg (compression alters the pixels and ruins encryption).
